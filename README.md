# Monkeypox-Skin-Disease-Classification
A Convolution Neural Network Model that can classify whether a person is having chickenpox, measles, monkeypox or the person is normal with the help of image.

Training data is taken from kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipuiucse/monkeypoxskinimagedataset

An improved model is created using VGG16 transfer learning that can easily predict any of the 4 cases
