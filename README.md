# Monkeypox-Skin-Disease-Classification
A Convolution Neural Network Model that can classify whether a person is having chickenpox, measles, monkeypox or the person is normal with the help of image.

## Portraying the Use of Transfer Learning
An improved model is created using VGG16 transfer learning, allowing it to easily predict any of the 4 skin disease cases. This project showcases the effectiveness of transfer learning in enhancing classification accuracy.

### With and Without VGG16
This repository demonstrates the contrast between two models:

1. **Base Model:** A Convolution Neural Network model developed without VGG16 transfer learning.
2. **Enhanced Model:** Utilizing VGG16 transfer learning for improved classification accuracy.

The enhanced model shows the advantages of leveraging pre-trained models like VGG16 to achieve better results in complex classification tasks.
